# ![](favicon-64x64.png) `custom_missions_user.tmc` installation instructions

To install a custom missions file in Aerofly FS 4:

1. Open a file explorer in your Aerofly FS 4 user folder, located at `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Aerofly FS 4`.
2. Open up the `missions` folder.
3. Put the new `.tmc` file into the `missions` folder,
   and rename it to `custom_missions_user.tmc`.
4. On starting Aerofly FS 4, your custom missions will be loaded from the
   new `custom_missions_user.tmc`.

Be aware that there is only on `custom_missions_user.tmc` at any given time.
If you have multiple mission files, rename them accordingly and keep backups of the original files.

In case your Aerofly FS 4 installation gets damaged in this process, consider
a fresh installation.
