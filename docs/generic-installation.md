# ![](favicon-64x64.png) `custom_missions_user.tmc` installation instructions

To install a custom missions file in Aerofly FS 4:

1. Open a file explorer in your [Aerofly FS 4 user folder](https://www.aerofly.com/dokuwiki/doku.php/simulator:path). Usually this is located at:
   - `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Aerofly FS 4` (Microsoft Windows)
   - `~/Library/Containers/com.aerofly.aerofly-fs-4-mac/Data/Library/Application Support/Aerofly FS 4` (Apple Mac OSX, App Store Version)
   - `~/Library/Application Support/Aerofly FS 4` (Apple Mac OSX, Steam Version)
2. Open up the `missions` folder. If this folder does not exists, create it.
3. Put the new `.tmc` file into the `missions` folder,  
   and rename it to `custom_missions_user.tmc`.
4. On starting Aerofly FS 4, your custom missions will be loaded from the new
   `custom_missions_user.tmc`.  
   The custom missions can be found in Aerofly FS 4 in
   ["Main Menu" > "Challenges"](https://www.aerofly.com/tutorials/missions/) at the very end of the challenges list.  
   (Alternatively you will find you flights via "Main Menu" > "Flights" > "Aircraft list".)

Be aware that there is only one `custom_missions_user.tmc` at any given time.
If you have multiple mission files, rename them accordingly and keep backups of the original files.

In case your custom missions cannot be found, you may want to take a look at `tm.log` in your [Aerofly FS 4 user folder](https://www.aerofly.com/dokuwiki/doku.php/simulator:path).

In case your Aerofly FS 4 installation gets unusable by this process, just delete the `custom_missions_user.tmc`.
