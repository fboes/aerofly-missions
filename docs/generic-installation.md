===========================================

To install a custom missions file:

1. Open a file explorer in your Aerofly FS 4 game folder.
2. Open up the `missions` folder.
3. Rename `custom_missions.tmc` to any other file name,
   e.g. `_custom_missions.tmc`.
4. Put the new `.tmc` file into the `missions` folder,
   and rename it to `custom_missions.tmc`.
5. On starting Aerofly FS 4, all your custom missions will be loaded from the 
   new `custom_missions.tmc`.

To revert back to the original custom missions file, simply delete the new file 
and rename the old file `_custom_missions.tmc` back to `custom_missions.tmc`.

In case your Aerofly FS 4 installation gets damaged in this process, consider
a fresh installation.
