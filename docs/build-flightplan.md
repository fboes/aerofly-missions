## How to build in Aerofly FS 4

1. First check if your airports exist in Aerofly FS 4.
1. Build a basic flight plan in Aerofly FS 4.
   1. You may want to use named checkpoints in Aerofly for your flight plan: VORs, NDBs and waypoints / fixes.
   1. Think about alternate airports along your route, or at least emergency landing sites.
1. Rebuild the flight plan in a flight planning tool like [SkyVector: Flight Planning / Aeronautical Charts](https://skyvector.com/); you may want to use `aerofly-missions --skyvector`. Take a proper look at:
   1. Runway length
   1. Restricted airspace
   1. Terrain heights (see [maximum elevation figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_elevation_figure))
   1. Weather reports
1. Check if your plan is legal to fly under [visual flight rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_flight_rules) or [instrument flight rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_flight_rules) rules.
1. Set time and weather conditions in Aerofly FS 4 to match real life conditions. (You may want to use the [Aerofly WettergerÃ¤t](https://github.com/fboes/aerofly-wettergeraet/) to get weather data.)
1. Modify your flight plan in Aerofly FS 4. (Be aware that nav data in Aerofly FS 4 is out of date and may not match real world data.) You may want to [import the flight plan](./importing-flightplans.md).
   1. Match the waypoints from your flight planning tool.
   1. Adjust the cruise altitude.
   1. Set your departure and approach to head into the wind.

## Airspaces

It is very important to know your [airspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace_class#ICAO_definitions). Europe is tightly controlled, so check for no-fly zones and controlled airspace.

> - Class C/D: All aircraft are subject to ATC clearance
> - Class E: Aircraft operating under IFR and SVFR are subject to ATC clearance.
