Reno Air Races
========================

Welcome to the [Reno Air Races](https://airrace.org/). Make yourself familiar with [Air Races Course and Rules](https://airrace.org/the-course-pits/), because once you are in the air there will be no time to consult a map. (And because your navigational map may not show a course set so tight and precise as the Reno Air Races Courses.)
