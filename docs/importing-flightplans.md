![](favicon-64x64.png) Importing flight plans
==================================

The Aerofly Missionsgerät is also able to convert other flight plan formats into a custom mission file. As of now this works for:

* Import Garmin `fpl` Flight Plan file into Aerofly FS 4
* Import [Microsoft FS `pln` Flight Plan file](https://docs.flightsimulator.com/html/Content_Configuration/Flights_And_Missions/Flight_Plan_Definitions.htm) into Aerofly FS 4

Instructions
------------

1. Download a flight plan.
2. Run the Aerofly Missionsgerät with the parameter, telling it were to find the external flight plan file.
3. The Aerofly Missionsgerät will read all settings from the `main.mcf` but for the Aerofly flight plan. Instead it will read the external flight plan.
