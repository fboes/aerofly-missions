The long story
--------------

Born on the Åland Islands in the 30's, young Carl had always a passion for adventure… and engineering. Almost untouched by events form World War II, Carl travelled to sea working with his twin brother Magnus in his father's fishing company, before getting his first job as a ship build on a Åland wharf.

But even more fascinating than ships were aircraft to him. This in turn caused him to study engineering in Stockholm in the 50's. Leaving Åland and his father's business behind caused a break with his parents and brother. Up until Carl's death the families never got back in contact. 

In Stockholm he met Varvaara, an artist whose family had fled from Soviet-occupied Estonia. They became married in the 60's and moved to Linköping because of Carl's job with Saab. Their relation was passionate but complicated - Varvaara moved back to Stockholm to fullfill her artist destiny. 

Even though they were in a long-distance relationship, their daughter Britt and son Einar were born in the 70's. For Carl this was a bitter-sweet experience, as Varvaara moved to Copenhagen, taking along both children.

In the 80's Carl moved to Germany to work for Airbus. This also brought him closer to his wife which lived in Copenhagen. In the 90's Einar moved to Bergen (Norway) to work for an oil company, while Britt became an artist in Oslo. Both children never had a strong relationship with their father.

Einar died in an helicopter crash on New Years Eve 2000, leaving behind a wife and four kids. Carl and Varvaara were both struck, but dived head-first into work instead of reconsolidating.

Later on things got quieter. As Carl retired in the 2000's, the family moved back together. Varvaara even reacquainted with her far family in Talinn, so Carl and her would be seen flying together to Estonia.

Varvaara died in the 2010's of cancer, which left Carl more or less alone.
