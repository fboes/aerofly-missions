Carl's Homecoming
=================

Carl has passed away at age 92. After living a life full of adventures, moving between many cities in Northern Europe, he has finally come to a rest.

Being a close friend to him, your name came up in his testament. You are to carry his urn to the important places in his life - in his beloved private plane, a [Pitts S-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitts_Special). Well, and you are forbidden to use any modern navigation devices. Carl was always an old-schooler.

So take a seat in Carl's Pitts S-2, and starting in Hamburg travel up to Denmark, Sweden and finally Finnland.

Installation
------------

To install this custom mission file:

1. Open a file explorer in your Aerofly FS 4 game folder.
2. Open up the `missions` folder.
3. Rename `custom_missions.tmc` to any other file name,
   e.g. `_custom_missions.tmc`.
4. Place the [`custom_missions.tmc`](custom_missions.tmc) in the `missions` folder.
5. On starting Aerofly FS 4, all your custom missions will be loaded from the 
   new `custom_missions.tmc`.

To revert back to the original custom missions file, simply delete the new file 
and rename the old file `_custom_missions.tmc` back to `custom_missions.tmc`.

In case your Aerofly FS 4 installation gets damaged in this process, consider
a fresh installation.

The tour
--------

Each leg is about 130 kilometres (70 nautical miles). Which is just as well, because the Pitts was never built for cross-country flights, with its tiny fuel tank limited to about 120 nautical miles of full throttle flight.
