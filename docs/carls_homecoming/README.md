# Carl's Homecoming

Carl has passed away at age 92. After living a life full of adventures, moving between many cities in Northern Europe, he has finally come to a rest.

Being a close friend to him, your name came up in his testament. You are to carry his urn to the important places in his life - in his beloved private plane, a [Pitts S-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitts_Special). Well, and you are forbidden to use any modern navigation devices. Carl was always an old-schooler.

So take a seat in Carl's Pitts S-2, and starting in Hamburg travel up to Denmark, Sweden and finally Finnland.

## The tour

Each leg is about 130 kilometers (70 nautical miles). Which is just as well, because the Pitts was never built for cross-country flights, with its tiny fuel tank limited to about 120 nautical miles of full throttle flight.
