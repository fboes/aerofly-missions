# 06: The Lake where Gripens play

Old friends of Carl have invited you to an interesting trip, clearing your for passing the restricted airspace over lake Vättern. Keeping strictly to your route, you make your way to Karlsborg, famous for its fortress. There your are cleared to land on the military air base - so don't mess up your landing as Carl's friends are watching.

## Carl's letter

> After university I started at Saab, and was part of the engineering team which build the Saab Viggen. Oh, what a joyful little bird. I had lots of friends in the Swedish air force, and we often got together on formal and informal meetings. Even though I have never been in the military, I visited so many air bases most personal treated me as one of their kind.
>
> The Viggen jockeys met in Karlsborg, where Saab got feedback from the real-life experience of Viggen flying. As the Viggen was able to land on streets, there were lots of interesting stories.
>
> Even when I left Saab, I still was invited to see the Viggen pilots gatherings. Later on it was less about flying the Viggen (now replaced by the Gripen) but sitting around campfires and sharing a good laugh.
