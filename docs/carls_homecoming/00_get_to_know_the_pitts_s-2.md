# 00: Get to know the Pitts S-2

Carl's Pitts is waiting for you to practice some takeoffs and landings. She is quite a handful, so take your time to get it right. You are starting at Carl's former workplace: Airbus in Hamburg.

The Pitts S-2 is a [tail dragger](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_Dragger) - so [landing techniques](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BwvCvieZN4) are somewhat difficult to master. You will practice quiet a few go-arounds.

## Carl's letter

> Take good care of my Pitts S-2. She is nearly as old as I am. I got her back when I worked for Saab in Linköping. You know, aviation has always been my secret passion, even though I grew up in a family of fishermen in a nice little coastal town on Åland. Building planes and flying them was my life - but the sea had its place too.
