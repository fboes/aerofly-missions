Carl's letter
-------------

> Today we are going to the old airport of København. I know this route by heart, because when I moved to Hamburg I used to travel a lot, to see my wife Varvaara.
>
> She being an artist and me being an engineer, we always had a very… passionate relationship. When we moved to Linköping, after some years she became weary of the "backcountry life" as she would call it. She moved backt o Stockholm where we met - and later on to København.
>
> Even though it is hard to understand, we were still very much in love with each other. We did not really split up - but we lived in separate worlds. Our letters and visits were numerous - as well as our fights and arguments.
>
> Well, Varvaara was a force. Wherever she appeared people would turn their heads and listen to this beatiful, intelligent woman with the deep voice and the Estonian accent.
>
> Please be so kind and visit her in København. Maybe she wands a quick ride with the Pitts - even though she hated flying, she loved flying with me and the Pitts.
