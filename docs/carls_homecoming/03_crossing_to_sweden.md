03: Crossing to Sweden
==================

Beautiful [København](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen)! Flying around the busiest airport of Denmark requires you to fly above 1500 MSL. But you get to see [Øresund Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%98resund_Bridge), linking the twin cities of København and Malmö.

Later on you cross the Øresund between the twin cities of Helsingør and Helsingborg.

Carl's letter
-------------

> Our kids were born in the Seventies. Varvaara had already moved to Stockholm, and later on took Einar and Britt to København, were they grew up. I was not happy about her decision, but I understood that she had to move to a bigger city to be an artist. I stayed with Saab, working as an engineer. Back than the famous Øresund Bridge did not exists, so I flew to see my wife and kids. Most often I would take my Pitts.
>
> Even though we lived apart, these still were happy times. The kids were always happy, as most often was Varvaara. We never considered moving back together.
>
> Well, our kids later on followed suit and moved away.
